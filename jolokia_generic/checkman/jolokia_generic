description:
 This Check allows to monitor any given MBean/Attribute of an Application server.
 It is possible to monitor nummeric, either as rate or as gauge value and Strings
 matching a given List of Parameters.

 To use this plugin, Jolokia and the agent plugin needs to be deployed
 on the monitored server in each application container.

 The check can alert if the values fall or climb to configurable {WARN}/{CRIT} thresholds
 or the value is not in a list of strings.

 For Configuration of the agent see cfg_examples/jolokia.cfg.
 Thresholds are configurable in WATO.


item:
 The name of the application server instance or Servlet as configured by the agent.

perfdata:
 The rate or gauge value(s) as configured by the agent or none on strings.

inventory:
 One check is created for each configuration item on the agent side.


[parameters]
For nummeric Values:
low_warn (float): If the value falls to this level,
 a WARNING state is triggered
low_crit (float): If the value falls to this level,
 a CRITICAL state is triggered
high_warn (float): If the value climbs to this level,
 a WARNING state is triggered
high_crit (float): If the value climbs to this level,
 a CRITICAL state is triggered

For String Values:
expectedStrings (Array of Strings): A CRITICAL state is triggered if 
 the MBean/Attribute returns a value not specified in this list. An empty list
 does will always return OK state.

[configuration]
jolokia_generic_default_levels: { "levels" : (float, float, float, float), "expectedStrings" : [] }
Default levels: { "levels" : (-1.0, -1.0, 0.0, 0.0), "expectedStrings" : [] }
